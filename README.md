# Creating a Template for my Portfolio

This project is just to make a template for a porfolio so that I get to understand some of concepts about UI design. It helped me understand basic layouts in CSS like flexbox and also gave some insight in using react components.

It helped me get comfortable with using external libraries like tailwind (for basic design), aos and react-scroll-parallax (for some of the animation).

The page looks like this and further changes might me made in the future.
